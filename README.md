The purpose of my script is to load data into R, organize the data, create graphs to show correlations, and perform Exploratory Data Analysis. In order to run my script you need the files,  “Gene_Expression_Data.xlsx”, “Gene_Information.csv”, and “Sample_Information.tsv”, to be loaded into RStudio. These files include information on gene information and expression. During the process of running my script, multiple graphs such as a histogram, a clustermap, a bar chart, and a heatmap should be created.  In order for my script to run, the libraries needed are library(readxl) and library(magrittr). In order to run my script on any machine, RStudio needs to be downloaded and initialized. The code should then be ran and the outputs should show.
